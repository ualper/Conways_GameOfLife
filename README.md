# CONWAY’S GAME OF LIFE

**Conway's Game of Life is a cellular  automaton that is  devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.**

Cellular automata is a discrete model of computation studied in automata theory.       
Cellular automata have found application in various areas, including physics, theoretical biology , chemistry and computer science.
A cellular automaton consists of a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states, such as on and off.




A cellular automaton is said to be Life-like if it meets the following four criteria:
* It has two dimensions (i.e., n=2).
* It has two states, usually called OFF and ON (i.e., |S|=2).
* It uses the Moore neighbourhood.
* The new state of a cell in the next generation can be expressed as a function of the number of cells in its neighbourhood that are in the ON state and the cell's own state; that is, the rule is outer totalistic

**Most popular Life-like cellular automaton is Conways Game of Life**

GoL Game  played on a 2D square  grid. Each cell on the grid can be either alive or dead, and they  evolve according to the following rules:​

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (referred to as underpopulation).​

- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, steps to the next generation.​

- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (referred to as overpopulation).​

- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours comes to life, (referred to as reproduction)​
